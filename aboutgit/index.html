  About Version Control Systems  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code. Version control enables multiple people to simultaneously work on a single project. Each person edits his or her own copy of the files and chooses when to share those changes with the rest of the team.
      Thus, temporary or partial edits by one person do not interfere with another person's work.

    About Git and Github  </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features.
        While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface.

              Branching and merging. Having team members work concurrently is a no-brainer, but even individuals working on their own can benefit from the ability to work on independent streams of changes.

                Provide Traceability. Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bug tracking software such as Jira, and being able to annotate each change with a message describing the purpose and intent of the change can help not only with root cause analysis and other forensics.
